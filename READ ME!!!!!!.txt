1. EVERYONE in the server must follow BOTH of these guides:

^ ^ ^ ^ ^ IMPORTANT ^ ^ ^ ^ ^

2. Port forward the port 25565.
Here are some links to help you port forward:

http://www.portchecktool.com/

3. Open "Start Server.bat". (don't open as Admin) If it brings up an issue about Java, edit the .bat file with a text editor and replace "Java" with the location to your Java installation (usually "C:\Program Files (x86)\Java\jre8\bin\javaw.exe").

4. Lots of biome errors will show at the end. That's when you know the server has started. (working on a fix)

5. Connect to the server.



If you are having trouble, read https://rebirth-of-the-night-mod-pack.fandom.com/wiki/Installation

Only increase RAM if you plan to play with many people!
If you want to increase the server RAM, edit "Start Server.bat" with a text editor and replace the entire thing with:
@ECHO OFF
java -Xmx6048M -Xms6048M -jar forge-1.12.2-14.23.5.2838-universal.jar nogui
pause

The server has 4GB by default, which should be plenty, but if you plan to have more than 4-5 people play, change it to 6GB maximum, anymore will cause it to lag.
